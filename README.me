# Hospital Risk Velocity Engine 🏥 📈

An executive-level surveillance dashboard that applies **kinematic principles (Velocity & Acceleration)** to hospital incident data. Instead of just tracking incident volume, this engine identifies "Risk Surges" by calculating the momentum of harm.

## 🚀 The Core Theory: Harm Acceleration
Standard hospital reporting is **reactive**. This project introduces a **proactive** metric:
* **Risk Magnitude:** Current total harm score (RPN).
* **Risk Velocity:** The rate at which risk is changing over a sliding window (3, 7, or 15 days).
* **Risk Acceleration:** The "Early Warning." It detects if risk is not just rising, but *compounding*, allowing leadership to intervene before a sentinel event occurs.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Dynamic Sensitivity:** Toggle between Tactical (3-day), Operational (7-day), and Strategic (15-day) views.
- **Automated Hotspot Detection:** The app automatically identifies the specific unit with the highest risk momentum.
- **Apple-Matte UI:** A clean, executive-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- **Strategic Action Plan:** Automatically generates intervention recommendations based on data trends.

## 📦 Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Generate the static brief: `python risk_velocity_engine.py`
4. Launch the dashboard: `streamlit run app.py`

## 📊 Data Source
The system processes `hospital_risk_data.csv`, mapping Harm Levels (A-I) to a numerical RPN (Risk Priority Number) scale to perform time-series kinematics.
